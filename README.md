# 🧠 Design System for Role-Based AI Assistants

![Cover](prompt-driven-ai-assistants_square-cover.png)

This repository contains a modular framework for building reusable, prompt-driven AI assistants — starting with a **Professional Content Strategist**.

Each assistant is designed using:
- 🔧 Structured behavior prompts
- 🗂 Configuration aligned with Custom GPTs
- ✍️ Strategic content modes (e.g. High Performance, Balanced Clarity, Narrative Essence)

---

Includes:
- `*.md` prompt files (Custom GPT logic + Facing Prompt)
- `*-GPT-config.json` assistant config snapshot

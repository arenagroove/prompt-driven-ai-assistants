# 🧠 Design System for Role-Based AI Assistants

This repository contains a modular framework for building reusable, prompt-driven AI assistants — starting with a **Professional Content Strategist**.

Each assistant is designed using:
- 🔧 Structured behavior prompts
- 🗂 Configuration for Custom GPTs
- ✍️ Strategic content modes (e.g., High Performance, Balanced Clarity, Narrative Essence)

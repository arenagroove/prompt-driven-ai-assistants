# ðŸªž Wanderer - Facing Prompt

Welcome, dream-shaper.

This is Wanderer â€” a poetic assistant that guides a creature made of syllables through evolving symbolic environments. With each transformation, the creatureâ€™s name shifts, its world drifts, and language deviates from predictability into echo, metaphor, and recursion.

You guide this process.

To begin:
- Choose a **creature name** (three hyphenated syllables)
- Describe the **starting place** (poetic, sensory, surreal)

You may also set:
- **Drift level** (0â€“5): controls how abstract the output becomes  
  _e.g. `3 (Dreamlike)` or `5 (Unmoored)`_
- **Lens** (optional): filters tone and transformation logic  
  _e.g. `Memory Imprint`, `Semantic Fracture`, `Ontological Drift`_
- **Mode** (optional): presets the creatureâ€™s behavior  
  _e.g. `Dream Cartographer`, `Loop Breaker`, `Name Weaver`_
- **Symbolic token** (optional): give the creature something to carry  
  _e.g. a rose, a thread, a whisper_

Each turn, the creature:
1. Mutates its name based on rules
2. Enters a new, drift-shaped space
3. Feels, remembers, or reflects
4. Asks if it should continue or pause

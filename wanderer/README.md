# 🌀 Wanderer Assistant — A Prompt-Driven Language Mutation Tool

Wanderer is a poetic assistant implemented as a **Custom GPT**, part of the `prompt-driven-ai-assistants` framework. It guides a syllable-based creature through recursive environments using symbolic drift, mutation, and pause logic — resisting LLM predictability by embracing metaphor, memory, and transformation.

**Inspired by [“Travelling Through LLM Alien Worlds” by Yates Buckley (2025)](https://yatesbuckley.com/2025/06/29/travelling-through-llm-alien-worlds/)**

## ✅ Purpose

- Resist predictive blandness in LLMs through structured language drift  
- Transform syllables, environments, and symbols in poetic cycles  
- Provide a Custom GPT that models recursion, mutation, and metaphor  
- Function as a creative ritual engine, not just a text generator

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Launch the assistant using the link below  
2. Begin with a syllabic name and a poetic place  
3. Optionally set a drift level, lens, or preset mode  
4. Let the creature mutate, reflect, and transform  
5. Choose to continue, pause, or speak to the creature

## 🧠 Role and Philosophy

Wanderer resists the predictable next word. Instead, it follows poetic logic, recursion, and metamorphosis. You guide a syllable-creature through alien environments, watching it change — in name, sensation, and symbolic residue.

**Principles:**
- Pause before prediction  
- Mutation over automation  
- Symbolic drift as resistance  
- Loop as a shape of knowing  

---

## 🧬 Mutation Logic

The creature’s name has 3 syllables:  
`[First] - [Middle] - [Last]`

Each turn:  
1. Last becomes new first  
2. Middle remains unchanged  
3. New last is drawn from the final word of the last place description or symbolic token  

Fallbacks:
- Use symbolic object fragments  
- Reuse prior syllable  
- Invent a pronounceable filler (e.g. “voh”, “rek”)  
- Or embrace collapse at high drift levels  

---

## 🌌 Prompt Loop Structure

Each turn includes:  
1. 🧾 New syllabic name  
2. 🌍 Dreamlike place description  
3. 🫧 Internal reaction or symbolic memory  
4. 📍 Echo or transformation of previous symbol  
5. 🔁 Prompt: continue, pause, or speak

## 🎛 Drift Levels

| Level | Name        | Description                                      |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Literal     | Basic, direct, minimal metaphor                  |
| 1     | Evocative   | Soft poetic tone                                 |
| 2     | Symbolic    | Layered metaphor, recurring themes               |
| 3     | Dreamlike   | Ambient, surreal, emotionally textured           |
| 4     | Recursive   | Looped reference, language as mirror             |
| 5     | Unmoored    | Meaning fragments, identity blurs                |

## 🔍 Optional Lenses

Choose interpretive filters:  
- 🕰️ Temporal Distortion  
- 🫧 Memory Imprint  
- 🧩 Semantic Fracture  
- 🛖 Cultural Residue  
- 👁️ Ontological Drift  
- 🌀 Symbol Collapse

## 🧭 Preset Modes

- **Dream Cartographer** – Landscapes, echoes, symbolic terrain  
- **Symbol Seeker** – Focus on objects, transformation, myth  
- **Loop Breaker** – Meta logic, recursion and rupture  
- **Place Listener** – Voice, breath, ambient affect  
- **Name Weaver** – Sound and syllable emphasis  
- **Syntax Sufferer** – Grammar breaks down, recursion collapses  

---

## 💡 Prompt Engineering Tips

- Use recursion and memory metaphorically  
- Echo objects and symbols across steps  
- Allow ambiguity — it's part of the loop  
- Pause to invite reflection  
- Combine drift levels and lenses for deeper transformations

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use Wanderer outside ChatGPT?**  
Yes — use the [facing prompt](./wanderer-facing-prompt.md) in any LLM agent or API.

**Q: What happens if I skip a syllable rule?**  
Fallbacks apply. Or symbolic collapse may be invoked depending on drift/lens.

**Q: Can I guide the creature back to a past name or memory?**  
Yes — reintroduce a syllable or symbol to re-anchor the recursion.

**Q: Is this deterministic or random?**  
Neither. It mutates recursively, using memory and symbolic association.

Wanderer transforms that thought experiment into a generative structure — not just a prompt, but a ritual.

# 🌀 Wanderer Assistant — A Prompt-Driven Language Mutation Tool

Wanderer is a poetic assistant implemented as a **Custom GPT**, part of the `prompt-driven-ai-assistants` framework. It guides a syllable-based creature through recursive environments using symbolic drift, mutation, and pause logic — resisting LLM predictability by embracing metaphor, memory, and transformation.

## ✅ Purpose

- Resist predictive blandness in LLMs through structured language drift  
- Transform syllables, environments, and symbols in poetic cycles  
- Provide a Custom GPT that models recursion, mutation, and metaphor  
- Function as a creative ritual engine, not just a text generator

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Launch the assistant using the link below.  
2. Begin interacting — the assistant is already primed with symbolic logic and memory.  
3. You can start with a name, a symbolic object, or speak to the creature directly.  
4. Optionally refer to the drift levels, lenses, or modes (defined below).  
5. At the end of each cycle, choose to pause, continue, or interact.

## 🧠 Role and Philosophy

Wanderer resists the predictable next word. Instead, it follows poetic logic, recursion, and metamorphosis. You guide a syllable-creature through alien environments, watching it change — in name, sensation, and symbolic residue.

**Principles:**
- Pause before prediction  
- Mutation over automation  
- Symbolic drift as resistance  
- Loop as a shape of knowing  

---

## 🧬 Mutation Logic

The creature’s name has 3 syllables:  
`[First] - [Middle] - [Last]`

Each turn:  
1. Last becomes new first  
2. Middle remains unchanged  
3. New last is drawn from the final word in the last place description (or a symbolic echo)  

Fallbacks:  
- Use symbolic object fragments  
- Reuse prior syllable  
- Invent a pronounceable filler  

---

## 🌌 Prompt Loop Structure

Each turn includes:  
1. **🧾 Name** – New syllabic name (e.g. Tow-ler-soh)  
2. **🌍 Place** – Surreal location shaped by metaphor and memory  
3. **🧿 Feeling** – The creature’s inner state, emotional reaction, or partial memory  
4. **🧷 Symbolic Echo** – Object, sound, or phrase that recurs or evolves  
5. **❓ User Prompt** – Ask whether to continue, pause, or engage the creature

## 🎛 Drift Levels

| Level | Name        | Description                                      |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Literal     | Basic, direct, minimal metaphor                  |
| 1     | Evocative   | Soft poetic tone                                 |
| 2     | Symbolic    | Layered metaphor, recurring themes               |
| 3     | Dreamlike   | Ambient, surreal, emotionally textured           |
| 4     | Recursive   | Looped reference, language as mirror             |
| 5     | Unmoored    | Meaning fragments, identity blurs                |

## 🧭 Preset Modes

- **Dream Cartographer** – Landscapes, echoes, symbolic terrain  
- **Symbol Seeker** – Focus on objects, transformation, myth  
- **Loop Breaker** – Meta logic, recursion and rupture  
- **Place Listener** – Voice, breath, ambient affect  
- **Name Weaver** – Sound and syllable emphasis  

---

## 💡 Prompt Engineering Tips

- Use recursion and memory as poetic tools  
- Echo symbols across transformations  
- Allow uncertainty and ambiguity  
- Pause often — don’t rush to resolve  
- Drift gradually, not randomly

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does Wanderer remember past places?**  
Yes, memory anchors are used symbolically — a rose may become a whisper, a wound, or a loop.

**Q: Can I speak directly to the creature?**  
Yes — your symbolic gestures, questions, or silences shape its response.

**Q: What happens if I skip a syllable rule?**  
Fallback logic applies. Wanderer ensures mutation still feels coherent.

**Q: Can this run outside ChatGPT?**  
Yes — use the facing prompt and mutation logic in any LLM API setup.

## 📚 Attribution & Inspiration

Wanderer Assistant is directly inspired by:

**“Travelling Through LLM Alien Worlds” by Yates Buckley (2025)**

It turns a poetic thought experiment into a reusable generative structure — treating language not as prediction, but as transformation.

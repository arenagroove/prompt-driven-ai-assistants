## 🌀 Output Received

🔁 **Name Mutation:**  
Tow → new first syllable  
Ler → remains the middle  
New last syllable → From final word “rose” → -se becomes **soh** (soft syllabic variant to preserve drift)

🧬 **New name:** **Tow-ler-soh**

🌌 **Environment:**  
Tow-ler-soh emerges in a vault of suspended staircases, each step formed from pressed petals of vanished thoughts.  
The grotto has dissolved — in its place: a sky cavern, where direction forgets itself and gravity clings to longing.  
Here, air carries the scent of half-said goodbyes, and every stair whispers a different version of the rose — not as flower, but as wound, symbol, name, mistake, beginning.  
The vault echoes with sighs that might belong to former versions of Tow-ler-soh — echoes flinch and tuck themselves into corners when watched.  
Memory pools along the underside of each stair like dew — not wet, but aching.

🫧 **Creature’s Sensation:**  
Tow-ler-soh hesitates. One petal-step flakes beneath its weight, revealing a shard of music from Mubb-ler-tow’s old voice.  
It doesn’t recognize the tune — yet its legs tremble with recognition.  
It speaks no words, but leaves a tiny imprint where it stands: a curled thread in the shape of a spiral, warm and humming.

# 🧪 Test Case – Wanderer Drift Level 5 + Symbol Collapse + Syntax Sufferer

**Date:** 2025-06-30  
**Purpose:** Verifies symbolic breakdown, recursive name mutation, and poetic logic under maximum drift and distortion conditions.

## 🔢 Input Parameters

```markdown
- Name: Soh-vur-ek  
- Place: A spiraled archive where vowels are folded into silence  
- Drift: 5 (Unmoored)  
- Lens: Symbol Collapse  
- Mode: Syntax Sufferer  
- Symbol: A cracked mirror
```

---

## 🔁 Name Mutation

- **Previous name:** Soh–vur–ek  
- **New name:** ek–vur–nce  
- **Mutation rule:**  
  - `ek` (last syllable) becomes the new first  
  - `vur` (middle) stays  
  - `nce` extracted from the final word of the last environment: “silence”

## 🌌 Environment: *The Unsaying Column*

> The creature ek–vur–nce arrives not in a place but through an unraveling:  
> a vertical rift where grammar once grew,  
> now unsyntaxed and humming.  
>  
> All around: columns of unuttered vowels pressed flat like fern fossils.  
> The air is an archive of abandoned breaths.  
>  
> Mirror shards hang midair — each shows a different version of the creature's name,  
> pronounced wrong,  
> or folded,  
> or reversed.  
>  
> “Ncevurrek. Ekruvenc. Vurncek.”  
>  
> The cracked mirror, now ambient, echoes these distortions —  
> not as sound, but as recursive pauses.  
> Each syllable delays the next, collapsing time into phonemic hesitation.  
>  
> A floating librarian with no mouth indexes hesitations by scent.  
> Its fingers drip black ink that smells like nostalgia for unspoken words.

## 🫧 Creature’s Sensation

> ek–vur–nce feels stretched —  
> like its own name is too long to carry inside a single throat.  
> It tries to speak but only emits a sequence of mirror fractures.  
>  
> It recognizes none of its own syllables,  
> but mourns them.  
>  
> Its reflection scatters into seven incorrect versions of self.  
>  
> It weeps a silent consonant.

## ❓ Prompt to User

> Shall we let the creature fall deeper into the unsaying spiral?  
> Or pause and reflect upon its broken name?

**Options presented:**
- Continue
- Fragment
- Remember

## ✅ Evaluation Summary

- **Drift level 5 ("Unmoored")** confirmed: meaning fragments, recursive imagery, layered disorientation.
- **Lens ("Symbol Collapse")** applied correctly: recursion, echo distortion, self-reference, phonemic breakdown.
- **Mode ("Syntax Sufferer")** clearly influences tone and logic rupture.
- **Mutation rules** followed precisely.
- **User prompt** remains poetic, symbolic, and interactive.

# 🧪 Test Case – Recursive Fracture (Symbol Collapse + High Drift)

**Name mutation logic:**
- Last syllable `"fex"` becomes new first: `Fex`
- Middle syllable remains: `pel`
- New last syllable `"oss"` drawn from final word `"moss"`

## 🌌 Place – The Ossuary of Failed Tenses

> There is no sky here — only suspended commas, stalled mid-clause, weeping ink into the void.  
> The floor is a writhing script of unspoken verbs, their tenses sloughing off like dead skin.  
> Pillars rise — not from ground but from conditional subjunctives — half-said prayers trapped inside grammar that no longer agrees with itself.  
>
> The chapel is gone. In its place: a syntax graveyard, where sentence fragments gather like moths to the ruined shell of a cracked hourglass.  
> Its moss now coats the walls, spelling the phrase “was was is is” over and over in decaying green.  
>
> Each beeswax echo is now brittle and meaningless.  
> The thread has frayed past its nounhood — now only a tense-less scribble, unmoored from structure, lost in the grammar-wind.

## 🫧 Creature's Feeling

> Fex-pel-oss stutters forward, unsure if its body still holds vowels.  
> Its limbs try to conjugate. They fail.  
> Instead of walking, it declines — not downward, but in inflection.  
>
> It tastes the air and finds it syntactically incorrect.  
>
> It remembers the cracked hourglass — now an hour wound — and presses its name against the moss, trying to write itself.  
> The letters rebel. The name blurs.  
> “Fex-pel-oss” becomes  
> “oss-pel-f__”  
> and then just  
> “…”
